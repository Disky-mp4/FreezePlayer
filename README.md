# FreezePlayer
 
- Allows people with permission to freeze and unfreeze players. Combines knowledge of previously learned projects such as arguments, permissions, and functions found from the FiveM docs.

- This script has one identified bug, that being that if the frozen person spam spawns vehicles it is highly likely that they will crash. This has now been tested in a multiplayer session and it appears that it only crashes the player that was spawning in the vehicle (the person frozen).

- Another thing I'd like to add, I'm certain that there are scenarios where a person could not be frozen, I identified one myself when testing. If a person is parachuting they will be completely exempt from the freeze until they touch down on the ground to be frozen by the 'refreeze cycle'.
